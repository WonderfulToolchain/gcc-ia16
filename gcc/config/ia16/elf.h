/* This is a hack.  When -melks-libc is specified, then, combined with the
   -nostdinc above, this hack will (try to) make GCC use the include files
   under the -melks-libc multilib directory, rather than the Newlib include
   files in the usual locations.

   We also need to extend the hack to
     * rope in the libgcc include directories --- via `include-fixed' ---
       since elks-libc's headers use libgcc's.
     * fall back on the include directories for the default calling
       convention (.../ia16-elf/lib/elkslibc/include/), in case the user
       says e.g. `-melks-libc -mregparmcall' and no include files are
       installed specifically for this calling convention.

   Again, this is a hack.  -- tkchia  */

/* For -nostdlib, -nodefaultlibs, and -nostartfiles:  arrange for the linker
   script specification (%T...) to appear in LIB_SPEC if we are linking in
   default libraries, but in LINK_SPEC if we are not (i.e. -nostdlib or
   -nodefaultlibs).

   If default libraries are used, then we want them to appear at the end of
   the ld command line, so LIB_SPEC is the right place to use.

   If default libraries are not used, then GCC will not use LIB_SPEC at all,
   so we need to rely on LINK_SPEC to pass the linker script to ld.

   As for the (undocumented) -r option:  I currently just arrange not to
   pass any linker script at all if -r appears.  (FIXME: This only really
   works if something like -nostdlib is also specified.  One is out of luck
   if they would also like to link in startup files or default libraries
   during -r.)  -- tkchia  */
